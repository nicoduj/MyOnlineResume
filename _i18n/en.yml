  JobSearch : I like Building. When I was a child, my favorites toys were (and still are) Legos. In my experience, from small projects to big ones, with or without direct management of a team, what I like most is to build software, as a team, piece by piece, and see end-users use them and like them. I see development as a huge Lego game, where you have to build new pieces, and assemble existing ones. I would like now to focus on a real software project, build for and with end users.
