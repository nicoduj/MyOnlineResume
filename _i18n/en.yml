  JobSearch : I like Building. When I was a child, my favorites toys were (and still are) Legos. In my experience, from small projects to big ones, with or without direct management of a team, what I like most is to build software, as a team, piece by piece, and see end-users use them and like them. I see development as a huge Lego game, where you have to build new pieces, and assemble existing ones. I would like now to focus on a real software project, build for and with end users.

    Name: Bernard Poll 
    Function: Managing Partner at OROXILIA
    Text: Nicolas is an innovative, creative and very business oriented technical manager. He’s very up-to-date on new technologies. Some could, in that way, call him a “geek”. But obviously, what Nicolas enjoys the most is using this knowledge to build products that will make companies and people’s live easier. Nicolas is very hands-on. He gains respect from his team and from others with a very natural “lead by example” attitude. I really enjoyed working with Nicolas and hope we could find some day an opportunity to do so again !
